# Massprint
Print a file on any open and vulnerable printer

Made this a long time ago so it should work if used properly. Printing process can also be pretty slow since no threading is used. 

*This script is not meant to be used on printers not owned by you, this is for education only*

Use `scanner.sh` to create a list of vulnerable printers using shodan. Make sure shodan is installed and initiated.

Use `print.py` to print, change the file to print and target list as needed.
